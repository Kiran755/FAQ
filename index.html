                        <p>While one might think that engineering is all about fun, they are definitely wrong! One should always focus on academics as well as co-curricular activities. Hiring companies would always first shortlist their candidates on the basis of their CGPA. Hence In Enginneering, Its all about balancing your extra-curricular activites with your academics.

                        <p>A strong foundation is a must in order to get into coding. Make sure you know all the basics of coding. You can start learning to code after you have learnt any one language. After you are done with the basics its always a good idea to make some projects to implement those basics. Then you can move onto harder concepts such as OOPS and data structures and algorithms.One of the best things about learning coding is the unlimited amount of resources you can find online. YouTube has a lot of great channels which teaches basics as well as advance coding free of cost!

                    It depends.
                    You may not need CP if you already are great in other things like Fronted, fullstack, android,blockchain or machine learning etc. 
                    Competetive coding is not easy, because its not just competition, Its a sport. People from accross the world participate in it on a daily basis.If you really enjoy coding then you might as well do CP for fun. But if you are not good at coding and want to try and explore different things then you should try other options like webdev, android development,etc. Hence, it depends on the person but it is not necessary to do CP for getting placements.
